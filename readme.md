# **Installation**

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

# **Running**

Run `npm run build` to start Webpack and build code

Run `npm run watch` to start Webpack and build code and watch for code changes

Website must be ran in an http server, if you don't have anything, I suggest `npm i -g http-server`
